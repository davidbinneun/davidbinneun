### hello ðŸ‘‹
Coding for fun from a young age, I majored in CS in high school and participated in the Cyber4s program for discharged combat soldiers. I'm a full-stack developer in the MERN stack but enjoy most using my design skills to produce elegant and responsive web applications. In my free time I make beats.
